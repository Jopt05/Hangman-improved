## Python Hangman Game
In this case I wanted to test my Python knowledge and elaborate a Hangman game with the use of assertions(something I recently learned).

**Caracteristics:**

- Shows the how many tries you had each time you're wrong.
- Shows the amount of tries when you win.
- Shows if you already entered a letter.

*Instructions:*

 1. Create a virtual enviroment


    py -m venv venv

   
 2. Run the virtual enviroment with

    .\venv\Scripts\activate
  
  

 3. Run the game:
 

    py main.py
